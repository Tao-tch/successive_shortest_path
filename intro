I. INTRODUCTION
In the domain of disaster management, Taiwan has to be particularly robust in the fact that 73% of its citizens are subject to natural disasters(world bank, 2005). 
Typhoons, floods, and earthquake all affect Taiwan and out of them, earthquakes are most difficult to prepare for as there is little to no warning as when 
and where it would strike. The most recent major earthquake in Taiwan is the 2022 Taitung earthquakes and 2016 southern Taiwan earthquake, 
which shook the island terribly. To address this issue, this research focuses on the preparedness and response section of disaster management, 
in which due to the randomness of the problem the latter requires stochastic programming methods to solve. Oksuz and Satoglu (2019) 
have done research on the two-stage stochastic model to solve the problem of medical supply allocation. 
However, it does not engage on the transportation issue of post disaster road networks. 
Yin, Yang, Yu, Wang, and Cheng (2023) analyzes the transportation side of the problem with trucks and drones, 
which deals with the issue of broken road network, but the resource allocation side is not solved. 
For this paper, it focuses on the problem of medical and transportation resource allocation with two-stage stochastic model 
and then solves it using simulation. Overall, it concludes that using drone in tandem with trucks can be a viable solution 
for transporting medical supplies to earthquake victims.
